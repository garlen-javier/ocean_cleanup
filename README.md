# Ocean Cleanup

Embark on a thrilling journey with Ocean Cleanup! An underwater sustainability game that challenges you to combat a formidable queen octopus, rescue marine life, and tackle ocean pollution head-on.

## Inspiration

We did research on other games before coming up with the idea of an underwater game. We had the idea of making the character go around the ocean simliar to how the character Mario in "Super Mario" moves in an underwater level. The leaderboard designs were inspired by the scoreboard from "Just Dance" . Furthermore, "Cuphead" final bosses inspired the octopus queen which is the main villian in the game that the player has to defeat in the final level. All in all we took a look at many different games in order to come up with a fun sustainable sea adventure.

## What it does

Ocean cleanup is a game where the player has to collect an amount of waste and release an entangled animal before the timer runs out in order to suceed.|

## How we built it

In the early phases of the project, we had to design the background, sea animals, plants, sharks, octopus queen and character animation using adobe and figma. After designing the game, the designers would send the developers spritesheets and image files so they had the tools they needed to create the game. The Tiled map editor was used as a level editor, object layers and spritesheets. The edits made using Tiled was then imported onto Flutter flame engine where the developers coded the game.

## Challenges we ran into

We lost a team member a couple of weeks before the intial design phase of our game so it took us a while to find another designer within the time frame. Another challenge that we had was converting the images from our design files to be small enough so the memory size wouldn't be large but also not reduce the quality so that can be used in flutter flame. Third challenge we ran into was intergrating the google wallet api. The google api could not be used in certain countries even with the use of VPN for our developers and thus they were unable to add it to the scoreboard.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were able to create a game based on what we had intially wanted in the game play such as the amount of levels (1 - 5) , adding sound effects , fixing the bugs we encountered when testing the game and creating animations for the plants and sea animals inside of the game using the spritesheet!

## What we learned

We have how to work in a mulitdisplinary team and create a space where each of us was able to use the specific skills we had in order to design and develop a game! For majority of us, this was the first time we had created a game . Which is why understanding the logistics of how to create a gameplay and using flutter to develop was a steep learning curve especially with the limited time we had.
